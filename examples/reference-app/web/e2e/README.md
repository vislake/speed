# reference-app end-to-end suite

The browser tier of the reference-app's tests: a real browser driving the
real composed UI against a real, freshly booted reference-app server.

```bash
# from examples/reference-app/web
pnpm test:e2e                     # boots both servers, runs every journey
pnpm test:e2e --headed            # watch it happen
pnpm exec playwright show-report  # the last run's report

# drive an already-running deployment instead of booting one
E2E_BASE_URL=https://your-deployment.example pnpm test:e2e
```

The first run compiles the Go server, which takes minutes; later runs
reuse the build cache and the whole suite finishes in seconds.

## Why this tier exists

Every tier below this one drives its requests through a scripted fetch
double, and a double answers whatever shape its author believed the
server sends. When the two drifted, nothing below this tier could tell:

- `@speed/api-client` required a `traceId` field on the error envelope.
  No backend writer has ever emitted one — every module's `writeError`
  and every OpenAPI fragment documents `{code, params}` — so every real
  error degraded to a synthetic `client.http.<status>` code that no
  reachable-error whitelist maps, and the deployed app rendered its
  generic "something went wrong" text in place of every specific
  message. Fixed in `f23079d`; three specs here are its regression gate
  (a refused sign-in, a too-short password, a refused write).
- Tenant isolation is a property of the server's own scoping. A
  component test asserting a list can only assert the list it scripted.
  `authorization.spec.ts` writes in one tenant and reads in the other.

That is the rule of thumb for what belongs here: a behaviour that only
exists when a real server answers. Component behaviour, rendering and
copy belong in the vitest suites under `src/`, which are faster and more
precise about it.

## What the suite knows about the server

Three facts shape the specs, and all three are the server behaving
correctly rather than obstacles to route around:

**Sign-in is rate-limited.** `go/authn`'s `ratelimit.go` allows five
sign-ins per account per minute (twenty per IP, ten registrations per IP
per hour) with progressive lockout. So the suite spends sign-ins
deliberately: one per spec file where it can, spread across the three
seeded demo accounts — the owner where a write is needed, the reader for
the account surface, the single-tenant account for the session-lifecycle
journey. There is no retry-on-429 helper, on purpose: a suite that
retried past a rate limit would stop being able to tell a real
regression from its own impatience.

**A fresh database per run is mandatory, not hygiene.** Demo-account
seeding deliberately skips an account a previous boot already created
(`cmd/server/demo_users.go`), so a reused database hands the suite
accounts with no memberships. `playwright.config.ts` puts the SQLite file
in the OS temp directory under a run-unique name.

**Which tenant an account lands in is not fixed.** Sign-in with no tenant
named resolves the account's first tenant from the host's
`MembershipReader`, and this host's seeding grants tenants while
iterating a Go map — randomized per boot and per account. So a spec reads
the tenant the frame actually landed in (`readCurrentTenant`) and
switches deliberately when it needs the other one (`switchTenant`).
Reported as a finding: a returning member of a multi-location practice
should land somewhere predictable, which is a host-side ordering
decision.

## Layout

| Path | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `password-sign-in.spec.ts` | Signing in, being refused, the SMS channel, a single-tenant account's scope |
| `registration.spec.ts` | Creating an account, the policy refusals, the duplicate-address conflict |
| `notes-surface.spec.ts` | The tenant-scoped business surface: read, write, the row that appears |
| `authorization.spec.ts` | What a read-only member may do, and tenant isolation across a switch |
| `session-lifecycle.spec.ts` | Signing out, the session-ended branch, signing back in, reloading |
| `account-surface.spec.ts` | Sessions, sign-in history, social bindings, two-step verification |
| `test-utils/accounts.ts` | The seeded demo accounts and the grants each one carries |
| `test-utils/journeys.ts` | Shared journey steps and every en-US string the specs assert on |

Specs are named for the journey they cover, never `e2e.spec.ts`, and
shared helpers live in `test-utils/` rather than being copied between
files (`.claude/skills/frontend-coding-standards/SKILL.md` §12).

Assertions quote the en-US bundles, and the browser context runs under
the en-US locale so the app's own language negotiation settles there from
`navigator.languages` — which exercises the negotiation path and keeps
every spec free of the CJK characters CI refuses outside `docs/internal`.

## Not covered yet

- **Demo accounts surviving a process restart** and **a really-invited
  user signing in to the invited tenant**: both wait on the sign-in
  membership fix, which is what makes them pass at all. They are the two
  gates this suite is missing on purpose rather than by oversight.
- **The CI pipeline.** `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` is still its stub
  guard; wiring it (Go toolchain, `playwright install --with-deps`, the
  artifact upload for traces) is the next step and belongs to whoever
  owns that pipeline's round.
- **Everything the product design calls for that has no UI yet** —
  patient photo upload, the AI simulation and its before/after view,
  share links, billing, team management, the admin console. The backends
  for most of them exist; the browser surfaces do not, so there is
  nothing for a browser to drive.
